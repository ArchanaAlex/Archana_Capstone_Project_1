        <h3>Project 1 - Fashion World</h3>
        <p>
          A fashion designer is a creative professional who designs clothing, accessories, or footwear by blending
          artistic vision with practical functionality. Their work involves creating original designs or modifying
          existing trends to produce innovative styles for different audiences, including haute couture, ready-to-wear,
          or mass-market consumers. Fashion designers often draw inspiration from various sources like culture, art,
          nature, or history. They conceptualize and sketch ideas that reflect a particular theme or trend, showcasing
          their unique design aesthetic. Fashion designers stay informed about global trends, consumer preferences, and
          market demands. They often predict future trends to create collections that align with or challenge prevailing
          tastes.

        <h3>Project 2 - Registration Form</h3>
        <p>
          A registration form website is a platform or webpage designed to collect user information for a specific
          purpose, such as event sign-ups, account creation, subscription enrollment, or service access. It typically
          includes a structured form where users can input their details. Here's a detailed description: A registration
          form allows websites to identify users by collecting essential information (e.g., name, email, preferences).
          It enables websites to deliver personalized experiences, such as tailored recommendations, saved preferences,
          or targeted content.
          A registration form is an essential component for any website, especially for businesses, services, and
          platforms that require users to sign up or create accounts.

          <p>
            An online shopping website offers a convenient platform where users can browse, select, and purchase a wide
            range of products from the comfort of their homes. With a user-friendly interface, it allows customers to

            tracking and customer support to ensure satisfaction. From electronics to fashion, and groceries to home
